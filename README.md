# MetaStage

MetaStage is a web3 platform for NFT creation and crowd funding. Using
the highly scalable Near blockchain, we implement code that allows creators
to:

1. Register and request funds from community (per epoch);
2. Build their portfolios and share their reputation.

At the funding level, users can use our platform to:

1. Support and funding any project a user sees fit;
2. Build their community status as creative art ventures.

Our main goal is to improve the content creation, in the digital era. This
is only possible if the majority of the revenues of content creation is
allocated to the actual creators, and not big corporations. For this reason,
we welcome inclusiveness of ideas, creative thinking and passion for
decentralization.
